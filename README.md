## Final Year Research Project
## Project Name - Smart Educational Tool for Early Detection of Learning Disabilities in Primary School Students
### Project Description

```
This repository contains the development of a mobile application designed to identify and support students with learning disabilities such as dyslexia, dyscalculia, dysgraphia, and ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder). Leveraging advanced technologies including machine learning, image processing, deep learning, and natural language processing, our application aims to provide tailored educational support to enhance students' learning experiences.

Key Features
Dyslexia Detection      : Utilizes deep learning and NLP to analyze specific reading patterns and spelling difficulties, identifying potential signs of dyslexia.
Dyscalculia Detection   : Employs image processing and machine learning algorithms to evaluate specific numerical understanding issues and identify math-related errors indicative of dyscalculia.
Dysgraphia Detection    : Uses deep learning to process handwriting samples, assessing for specific handwriting challenges characteristic of dysgraphia.
ADHD Monitoring         : Implements emotion recognition algorithms and behavior analysis to detect specific signs of inattention and hyperactivity associated with ADHD.

Objectives
Identification   : Detect the presence of learning disabilities in primary school students by analyzing key characteristics.
Intervention     : Provide personalized learning plans and timely interventions tailored to each student’s unique needs.
Support          : Facilitate a collaborative community for teachers, parents, and individuals to share experiences and specific activities to support students with learning disabilities.

Impact
By combining these technologies, our application seeks to revolutionize the identification and management of learning disabilities, promoting effective learning strategies and increasing educational equity and accessibility for all students.
